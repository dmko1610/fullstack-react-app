Fullstack React Application
==
This is my copy of the Maximilian Schwarzmuller React course.
Just tryna learn how to write good applications and have some fun.

If you want to look at this app, just clone this on your PC, 
CD into the client folder and run *npm i*
After that in terminal or console, perform the command *npm start*
That's it! 
Enjoy yourself.
